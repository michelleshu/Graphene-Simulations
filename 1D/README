Simulation of graphene-electrolyte interface (the electrical double layer)

1. Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) Equation for Potential Function (potential_1d.m)
	The electric potential distribution describing the electrical double layer
is modeled by cross-solving the Poisson-Boltzmann function for second 
derivative of electric potential and the three-point definition of a general
second derivative. The potential function is the basis for all subsequent
computations.
	
2. Potential and Ion Distribution v. Distance from Interface
	If all ions are of same valence, the distribution of positive and negative 
charges with respect to distance from the interface can be modeled by the
Boltzmann distribution.
	
	We examine the effects of bulk concentration, relative permittivity,  
effective ion size and valence on the functions of potential and ion
distribution in calc_potential_conc.m and graph_potential_conc.m
	
3. Total EDL Charge and Capacitance v. Applied Potential 
	Total charge in the EDL is obtained from second derivative of potential
function and the Poisson equation. The electrical potential distribution and
charge is computed for a range of applied potential values. Capacitance and
differential capacitance are computed from the function charge v.
applied potential.

	We examine effects of bulk concentration, relative permittivity, 
effective ion size and valence on charge and capacitance over a range of applied
potentials in calc_charge_cap.m and graph_charge_cap.m.

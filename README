Simulation of graphene-electrolyte interface (the electrical double layer)

1. Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) Equation for Potential Function
	The electric potential distribution describing the electrical double layer is simplistically modeled by cross-solving the Poisson-Boltzmann function for second derivative of electric potential and the three-point definition of a general second derivative.
	
	Main function for potential: pb_potential.m
	
	The effect of three parameters on electric potential function are modeled in pb_potential_params.m
	- Bulk ion concentration in solution
	- Applied surface potential
	- Permittivity

2. Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB)
	Same process as (1), but with modification to account for steric effects at larger potentials
	
	Main potential function : mpb_potential.m
	
2. Total EDL Charge over Range of Potentials
	
	Two methods are employed to compute the total charge contained within the double layer.
	- Use Poisson equation with second derivative of potential function to compute charge distribution. Integrate charge distribution (pb_charge_poisson.m)
	- Use Boltzmann distribution for potential function to compute ion concentration distribution, then convert to charge distribution and integrate (pb_charge_boltzmann.m)
		* Additional function for second method to graph ion concentration v. distance is pb_ion_concentration.m
		
	Capacitance function computed from total charge in previous step. Script to plot capacitance and differential capacitance is file pb_capacitance.m

EDLSIM - Simulations of EDL at graphene SGFET-electrolyte interface
Michelle Shu | Summer 2013

Main content is located in directory /2D. The more basic, older 1D simulation
is found in /1D and has its own README.

* MEX * ________________________________________________________________________
For much improved time efficiency, the bulk of this program is implemented in
the C language and integrated with Matlab as a MEX (Matlab Executable) file.
There is also a Matlab version (potential_2d.c), but don't use this, because it
is very slow. The MEX file must first be compiled on each machine on which it
is run. To do this manually, use the Matlab command:

>> mex potential.c

This should generate a file named potential.mex*, where * is particular to the
OS and processor. The resulting program can then be run by its name in the
command line just like a normal Matlab function.

>> [X, Y, P, R] = potential(P0, E_R, EFF_SIZE, )

If you are on a Mac and have problems graphing surface plots using Matlab's
surf, it is possibly an OpenGL issue. Try the command:

>> opengl neverselect

Simulation of graphene-electrolyte interface (the electrical double layer)

1. Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) Equation for Potential Function
	The electric potential distribution describing the electrical double layer is simplistically modeled by cross-solving the Poisson-Boltzmann function for second derivative of electric potential and the three-point definition of a general second derivative.
	
	Function: pb_potential.m
	
	The effect of three parameters on electric potential function are modeled in pb_potential_params.m
	- Bulk ion concentration in solution
	- Applied surface potential
	- Permittivity

2. Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) Equation for Potential Function
	Same process as (1), but with modification to account for steric effects at larger potentials
	Function: mpb_potential.m
	
	Parametric effects are modeled as in (1)

3. Total EDL Charge and Capacitance over Range of Potentials 
	Script charge_capacitance.m computes charge and capacitance over range of applied potentials P0_values
	
	Two methods are employed to compute the total charge contained within the double layer.
	- Use Poisson equation with second derivative of potential function to compute charge distribution. Integrate charge distribution (charge_poisson.m)
	- Use Boltzmann distribution for potential function to compute ion concentration distribution, then convert to charge distribution and integrate (charge_boltzmann.m)
